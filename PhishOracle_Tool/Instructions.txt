PhishOracle generates different variants of adversarial phishing webpages for a given legitimate webpage by adding randomly selected content and visual-based phishing features.
The file structure is as follows.
  1) urls.csv: Add legitimate URLs into this file
  2) add_total_features.txt: add an integer between 4 and 10 (represents the number of phishing features to embed in a legitimate webpage)
  3) download_legitimate_webpages.py: this code reads the URL(s) from urls.csv and downloads it/them into a directory
  4) adding_15_features.py: This file contains 15 content-based phishing features
  5) find_html_recursively.py: This file is the main file to run; it adds visual-based features (specific to logo), and calls the adding_15_features.py file to add remaining content-based phishing features.

Finally, we obtain an adversarial phishing webpage!!!
